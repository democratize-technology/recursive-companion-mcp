acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:

* **GitHub Repository**: Issues, pull requests, discussions, and code comments
* **Communication Channels**: Any official project communication channels
* **Events**: Conferences, meetups, or other events where the project is represented
* **Professional Settings**: When representing the project in professional contexts
* **Technical Communities**: Developer forums, technical discussions, or community events

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Dismissing or attacking someone for their level of experience or knowledge
* Gatekeeping or elitist behavior that discourages participation
* Spam or irrelevant promotional content

### Context-Specific Unacceptable Behavior

**Technical and Security Issues:**
* Sharing or requesting sensitive information (API keys, credentials, personal data)
* Deliberately introducing security vulnerabilities
* Ignoring security best practices in contributions
* Attacking or undermining security measures

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

### Reporting Process

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
please report it by contacting the project maintainers at:

* **Email**: code-developer@democratize.technology
* **GitHub**: Use the private vulnerability reporting feature for sensitive issues

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

When reporting, please include:

* Your contact information (if you wish to be contacted)
* Names of any other people involved (if any)
* Description of what happened and when it occurred
* Any additional context or evidence that would help with the investigation

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
project community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code
of Conduct, you may appeal the decision by:

1. Submitting a written appeal to code-developer@democratize.technology within 30 days
2. Including a detailed explanation of why you believe the decision was incorrect
3. Providing any additional context or evidence relevant to your case

Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders who were not involved in the original
incident or decision. The appeal process aims to be fair and thorough while
maintaining community safety.
