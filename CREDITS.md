# Credits

## Original Work
This project is based on **recursive-companion** by Hank Besser:
- Repository: https://github.com/hankbesser/recursive-companion
- The foundational Draft → Critique → Revise → Converge pattern
- Core refinement logic and approach

## This Implementation
MCP adaptation and incremental processing by Recursive Companion Contributors:
- Session-based architecture to avoid timeouts
- AWS Bedrock integration
- Domain detection and optimization
- Mathematical convergence measurement
- Progress visibility features

## Technologies
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic
- AWS Bedrock for Claude and Titan models
- Python asyncio for concurrent processing

## Special Thanks
- Hank Besser for the brilliant original implementation
- Anthropic for MCP and Claude
- AWS for Bedrock service
- The open source community
